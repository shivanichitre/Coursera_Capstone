The first step people take is to visit the ER if a medical issue arises. There are certain other places along with the Emergency Department that a patient might visit given the extent of their health issue. There is the urgent care, minute clinics, and primary doctors. However, a primary doctor requires an appointment ahead of time.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Consider this situation, say that you are a new person or a tourist in a town and a medical situation emerges.

It is not pleasant to wait that long when you are unwell."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### So what can you do?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Project Idea:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "My idea for the Capstone Project is to show that when driven by venue and location data from FourSquare, people can readily get a list of health services in a given area and the wait time in each location.  \nA high level approach is as follows:\n\n1. The user decides on a city location [for my project I will use New York]\n2. The ForeSquare website is scrapped for the top hospitals in the city\n3. From this list of top hospitals the list is augmented with additional grographical data\n4. Using this additional geographical data the top nearby hospitals are selected\n5. The average waittime of all venues are obtained\n6. A map is presented to the to the user showing the selected venues and waitime statistics of the locations.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Target Audience"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This can help the users or even healthcare workers to be effecient and allocate patients to seek their medical needs proficiently. If the medical emergency is urgent they can pick which location to go to with the least average waiting period in theory.\n\nBased on this information it is possible that customers may prefer to stay in the area with good hospitals along with lower wait times. It is a good idea for older people to live in the vicinty of a hospital or patients with chronic illnesses."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# 2] Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In this section, I will describe the data used to solve the problem as described previously.\n\nThere are many data science aspect of this project including:\n\n- Data Acquisition\n- Data Cleansing\n- Data Analysis\n- Machine Learning\n- Prediction\n\nAs noted below in the Further Development Section, this is a quite complex idea and in future we may need real time statistics to keep updating the capacity of hospital or a clinic while approaching this problem. However, as of now let's understand how to get the top medical care insitutions in a given area and look at their average history of wait time. The following scenario will be addressed:\n\n1. I will convert address data into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.\n2. For New york city neighborhood data, I will use wikipedia , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Districts of New York\n3. I will use the Foursquare API to explore New York neighborhoods and to get venues in neighborhoods.\n4. I will use the Foursquare API to get top locations and likes in neighborhoods.\n5. I will use the k-means clustering and Agglomerative algorithms to complete clustering task\n6.
